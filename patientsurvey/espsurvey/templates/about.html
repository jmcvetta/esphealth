<h2>Welcome to the <a href="http://www.phiconnect.org/">PHIConnect</a> ESP web interface</h2><p>
<p>
This is a demonstration of the ESP Survey web application, which in production will only be accessible on a local private network. This 
demonstration contains no real data - all the data here are synthetic and generally rather silly, but serve the purpose of 
illustrating how the application works. Even this demonstration requires authentication with a userid/password. These are available
from Ross. You will be challenged for these if you select any of the case viewing or administrative options. Once logged in, 
an authorized user can examine all the currently known "cases", each of which has a "workflow state". 
<p>
A "case" is a patient identified by one of the sets of criteria. The workflow states go from "awaiting review" through to "approved for 
sending". If you think a case does not really match, you can flag it as "false positive - do not send" - we should regularly review all of 
these with our State colleagues to figure out how to improve our rules. Alternatively you can move it into a holding state - "under review" 
while you contact the PCP for more information or wait for a test result to come in. When all is satisfactory, move it to "approved for 
sending" and the system will send it off to the health department. The record will hang around as "sent" but after 90 days, all the relevant 
clinical data will disappear - that raises an interesting problem for reviewing false positives - perhaps we should see if we can renegotiate 
to keep data on those cases until it's reviewed.
<p>
We don't have any real data here of course, so it's all done with silly test data. One important thing I need to figure out is whether to 
show *everything* known about each case, or just the items which met the criteria - I'd far prefer to show everything (all encounters/labs/rx in 
the past 90 days) because I think it's more flexible (and it's a lot less programming!) Unfortunately, without real data, I have no idea 
whether that's going to be overload? The other aspect I need advice on is whether the cases should be assigned to a specific reviewer or 
whether this will generally be managed by only one person?
