ESP is a disease surveillance application.  It can analyze large volumes of
electronic medical records to detect various medical conditions.  Support is
included for automatic reporting of notifiable diseases to public health
authorities.  Advanced data analysis and reporting tools are planned for a
future release.

ESP is written in Python, using the Django framework.   Since all database
calls are made using the Django ORM, ESP is database backend agnostic.  It can
work with any RDBMS supported by Django.

All documentation is available online at http://esphealth.org/.  If you are just
