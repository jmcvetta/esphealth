This is code for the ESP project

preLoader contains a whole bunch of stuff needed in tables for the case finder and for 
other aspects of configuration

ESP contains the main Django codebase

axis-1_4 contains patches needed for apache axis to work as the transport for connecting 
to the MA DPH Electronic Laboratory Reporting System and is probably irrelevant unless 
that's who you're sending messages to
