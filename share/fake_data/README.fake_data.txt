The files in this folder contain synthetic data for testing ESP.  This data is
not based on real medical records, and does not contain any PHI.  Consequently,
at its current state of maturity, this synthetic data may not reflect the full
variety of results found in real EMR data, nor will it contain any of the zany
idiosyncracies that make dealing with real data a challenge.  We are constantly
thinking about how to make our fake data more closely approximate real data,
and would be pleased to have your input.  Feel free to contact the ESP mailing
list <esp-health-dev@googlegroups.com> with any ideas.   

This data should be used for testing purposes only.  Your mileage may vary.
