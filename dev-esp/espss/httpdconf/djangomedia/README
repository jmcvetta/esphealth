softlink or copy this to a djangomedia directory at the root of your web site - eg 
/var/www/html so it can be picked up in the apache configuration sample supplied.

PLEASE edit the configuration file to reflect your own domain name and so on, before you fire 
up your web server with something like
sudo /usr/bin/apachectl -k restart 
When asked (by sudo), use your own (NOT root) password.
