The files in this folder are used at MetroHealth Medical Center to extracting
data from their Epic system for ETL to ESP.  The code is in MUMPS (fun fun...)
and apparently must be run inside the Epic instance.  

Channing Laboratory did not write these scripts, and cannot provide any support
for them.  Instead, please contact Myrtle Burton of MetroHealth
<mburton@metrohealth.org>, who provided these scripts; or Carla Lacombe of
Atrius Health <carla_lacombe@atriushealth.org>, who wrote the original code on
which these scripts are based.
